# shared

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This module should contain minimal shared `Components`, `Directives` and `Pipes`

It should not contain any `Injectables` such as `guards`, `services` , `state` etc. For that, use `CoreModule`

> import **SharedModule** in each lazy loaded **entry-modules** e.g., layout modules

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared` to execute the unit tests.
